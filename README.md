# Ovarian Cancer Bioinformatics Project

This project analyzes ovarian cancer patient data using Python. The dataset is split into three CSV files (`data_part1.csv`, `data_part2.csv`, `data_part3.csv`) due to size constraints. The analysis includes visualizations of patient features and progression probabilities.
