# Ovarian Cancer Bioinformatics Project

This project analyzes ovarian cancer patient data using Python. The dataset is split into three CSV files (`data_part1.csv`, `data_part2.csv`, `data_part3.csv`) due to size constraints. The project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and summaries of ovarian cancer progression probability.

## Project Description
-This project analyzes a large ovarian cancer dataset to explore factors influencing disease progression. By examining clinical, genetic, and demographic features, it identifies correlations and trends in progression probability. The work demonstrates applying computational methods to open-ended biological questions, highlighting both analytical and scientific reasoning.
