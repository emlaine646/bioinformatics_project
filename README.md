# Ovarian Cancer Bioinformatics Project

This project analyzes ovarian cancer patient data using Python. The dataset is split into three CSV files (`data_part1.csv`, `data_part2.csv`, `data_part3.csv`) due to size constraints. The analysis includes visualizations of patient features and progression probabilities.

Purpose: Analyze ovarian cancer patient data to identify patterns in clinical, genetic, and imaging features related to disease progression. This project explores how patient characteristics correlate with progression probabilities and cancer stage.

Tools Used: Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

Analysis Includes:

Histograms of key features (Age, BMI, CA125, Tumor Size, Progression Probability)

Correlation heatmaps to visualize relationships among numeric features

Average progression probability by cancer stage, with annotations highlighting subtle differences

My Role: Wrote Python scripts for data cleaning, visualization, and analysis; interpreted patterns and generated visualizations to summarize findings.

How to Run:

Install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt

Run analysis.py
